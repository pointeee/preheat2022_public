#lx, ly, lz: the domain size in each direction.
#num_pixels: the *total* number of pixels.
#map_nx, map_ny, map_nz: the number of map points. The map points are arbitrary but for now these n's are used to setup a uniform grid across the domain given above.
#corr_var_s: the signal cov prefactor sigma_f^2
#corr_l_perp: the signal cov perp scale.
#corr_l_para: the signal cov para scale.
#pcg_max_iter: the PCG max number of iterations. 100 should be good.
#pcg_tol: the PCG stopping tolerance. I found 1.0e-3 is good enough. Set it very small if you want the most accurate map.
